For Homework #1, you will be creating a webpage about YOU!  While this
assignment is intentionally open to interpretation, all submissions need
to include the following content:

-   a paragraph introduction

-   a picture of yourself

-   a list of hobbies on interests

-   a list of courses you are taking or have taken

-   a form to contact you (it does NOT need to actually work)

In general, I am looking for you to be creative and make a good effort
to explore the many features of HTML and CSS. At minimal, however, your
assignment needs to meet the following requirements:

-   Find ways to make use of the following tags:

    -   \<main\>

    -   \<header\>

    -   \<footer\>

    -   \<article\>

    -   \<section\>

    -   \<p\>

    -   \<img\>

    -   \<h1\>, \<h2\>, etc.

    -   \<table\> *(must be used to display tabular data)*

    -   \<ol\> or \<ul\>

    -   \<a\>

    -   \<input\>, \<select\> or \<textarea\> *(don't forget your form
        > tag and labels!)*

    -   \<button\>

-   Find ways to use the following CSS selectors:

    -   wildcard

    -   element

    -   id

    -   class

    -   attribute

    -   pseudo-class

    -   combined - any *(require any of these selectors)*

    -   combined - all (*require all of these selectors)*

    -   contextual

-   Find ways to use the following CSS style properties:

    -   box-sizing *(should be applied globally)*

    -   margin

    -   padding

    -   border *(or child properties of border)*

    -   position *(specifically, absolute and relative positioning)*

    -   display

    -   float *(don't forget to clear!)*

    -   overflow

    -   color

    -   background

    -   border-radius

    -   opacity

    -   z-index

    -   font (or child property of font)

-   All measurements should be in relative units

-   All styles must be in a CSS file

I will not be grading on aesthetics, but I do expect to see effort. That
may mean doing more than just the minimal requirements. Styles, for
example, should be used in ways that make sense. Be creative!
